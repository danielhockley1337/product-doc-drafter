# Dow Jones — Company Overview

## About

Dow Jones is a global provider of news, data, and analytics. It is a subsidiary of News Corp. Dow Jones publishes some of the world's most influential business and financial media across consumer subscription brands including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, and Investor's Business Daily.

This context repo covers the B2C (consumer) side of the Dow Jones business. B2B products (Factiva, Risk & Compliance, Newswires, DJ Platform) are out of scope.

As of the March 2026 Investor Briefing, Dow Jones described itself as a "news, data and intelligence powerhouse" — with authoritative editorial positioned as an essential input for the AI era.

## Financial highlights (FY2018–FY2025)

- Revenue base: **82% digital** (up from 60% in FY2018), **80% recurring** (up from 69%)
- **17% compound annual segment EBITDA growth** since FY2018
- Segment EBITDA margin: **25.2%** (nearly doubled since FY2018)
- Dow Jones has driven **11 successive quarters** of year-over-year Total Segment EBITDA growth at News Corp

## $1B EBITDA target

At the March 2026 Investor Briefing, News Corp detailed a pathway to **$1 billion in annual Dow Jones segment EBITDA within five years**, driven by:

- Accelerating Risk & Energy businesses (margin expansion)
- Accelerating direct-to-consumer offerings with new products and pricing
- Sharp focus on high-margin enterprise news
- Continuing cost discipline and operating leverage

## Key consumer brands

- **The Wall Street Journal** — flagship B2C subscription product; one of the largest paid digital news publications in the US
- **Barron's** — financial and investment news
- **MarketWatch** — real-time financial news and market data
- **Investor's Business Daily (IBD)** — acquired 2021
- **WSJ Pro** — premium vertical journalism for professionals
- **WSJ+** — multi-brand bundle subscription (WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, IBD)

## Headquarters

New York, NY (primary). Part of News Corp.

## Ownership

Subsidiary of News Corp (NWSA / NWS).

## Leadership

| Name | Title |
| --- | --- |
| Almar Latour | CEO, Dow Jones |
| Artem Fishman | CTO |
| Scott M. Havens | Chief Growth Officer & Global Head of Consumer |
| Emma Tucker | Editor in Chief, WSJ |
| Ryan Daly | SVP, Consumer Product |

## B2B brands (reference only)

These brands are out of scope for this repo but are included here for company-wide context. B2B and B2C share infrastructure (OneID, Factiva content, entitlements, APIs/feeds) so awareness of the B2B portfolio helps when working on cross-cutting systems.

### Factiva

Factiva is Dow Jones' flagship B2B research, monitoring, and discovery brand. It aggregates global news, business information, and reference data from Dow Jones titles (WSJ, Barron's, Newswires) plus thousands of external sources into a single professional research environment. Enterprise users rely on Factiva for competitive intelligence, market research, media monitoring, and risk insights.

Factiva is both a destination (Factiva.com) and a data platform. Its content powers other DJ products and partner workflows through APIs, feeds, and integrations. Internally, Factiva content is reused across Risk & Compliance (adverse media, investigations), WSJ Pro products, and analytics partnerships (e.g., sentiment signals). It sits in the "Research, Monitoring & Discovery" pillar of the B2B Professional Platform.

### Dow Jones Risk & Compliance (R&C)

Risk & Compliance helps organizations manage financial crime, sanctions, anti-bribery/anti-corruption, and third-party risk. It combines proprietary curated risk data (watchlists, sanctions, politically exposed persons, state-owned entities, adverse media) with purpose-built tools and services for regulatory and operational compliance workflows. R&C serves more than 10,000 customers worldwide, including many top financial institutions.

Key products include RiskCenter, the Risk Database tiers (Search, Research, Premium), due-diligence reports, and Risk Journal (a premium digital news product for compliance professionals with curated journalism on financial crime, sanctions, AML, and geopolitics). R&C is one of the primary engines of B2B growth, with significant investment in AI, feeds, and convergence with the broader B2B platform.

### Dow Jones Newswires

Newswires is the real-time news and data brand for professional and institutional users. It delivers rolling global business and markets coverage, economic indicators, corporate news, and expert analysis, often as the first publication point before content appears in The Wall Street Journal. Content is distributed as direct feeds, low-latency machine-readable text for quant users, widgets, and via professional desktops (Bloomberg, FactSet, Refinitiv).

Use cases span algorithmic trading (machine text feed), institutional research (NewsPlus dashboards), and enterprise integrations (APIs and feeds). Newswires is one of the three major B2B portfolios alongside Factiva and R&C, with modernization efforts (AI auto-translation, next-gen delivery) underway as products migrate into the DJ+ B2B platform.

### OPIS / Energy

OPIS (Oil Price Information Service) is Dow Jones' energy-data B2B brand, providing price benchmarks, news, and analytics across refined products, LPG, renewables, and related energy markets. Chemical Market Analytics by OPIS extends coverage into petrochemical and chemicals pricing and forecasting. Products are sold primarily to energy market participants who rely on benchmarks for trading, hedging, and operational decisions.

Within DJ's org structure, OPIS/Energy is treated as a separate B2B brand cluster with its own platform and entitlement complexities being gradually unified into DJ+. Strategically, OPIS broadens Dow Jones' B2B footprint beyond financial services into commodity and industrial markets while plugging into shared capabilities (entitlements, APIs/feeds, AI/data infrastructure).

## Competitive landscape

Dow Jones competes with FT, Bloomberg, NYT, and specialist financial media for digital subscribers.

## FILE:company/strategy.md
# Dow Jones — Strategy

## Strategic pillars

- **Subscription-first** — Consumer revenue is driven by paid digital subscriptions across WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, and IBD
- **Bundle growth** — WSJ+ bundle strategy is a key growth lever, expanding multi-product subscriptions across brands
- **AI as a monetization layer** — Dow Jones positions its authoritative editorial as an essential input for large AI models; licensing and AI product revenue are an expanding opportunity
- **Identity and first-party data** — The authentication and identity layer (OneID) is increasingly strategic, underpinning personalisation, bundling, and first-party data strategy
- **SEO and organic acquisition** — SEO is a primary top-of-funnel channel for WSJ and MarketWatch; positioning DJ properties for discovery via both traditional search and AI platforms

## North Star narrative (from March 2026 Investor Briefing)

Dow Jones frames itself as an **"Input company"** in the Age of AI — drawing an analogy to semiconductors and energy as inputs to the physical world. Authoritative editorial, trusted data, and proprietary risk/compliance intelligence are inputs to the digital and AI world. This framing underpins licensing deals with AI model providers and DJ's broader enterprise strategy.

> "As AI models are rippling from industry to industry, their output is only as good as their input, which is where Dow Jones comes in." — Almar Latour, CEO Dow Jones, March 2026

## Key strategic dynamics

- Platform team remit means solutions need to work across multiple brands and surfaces, not just solve for one
- Legal, privacy, and InfoSec reviews are standard for anything touching identity or billing
- Success metrics connect to subscription KPIs: paywall impressions, conversion rate, subscriber acquisition, churn, ARPU

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Where we compete |
| --- | --- |
| Financial Times | Business/financial news subscriptions |
| Bloomberg | Financial data, news, and professional terminals |
| New York Times | Digital news subscriptions, general audience |
| Specialist financial media | Vertical professional publications |

# Commerce — Overview

## What it is

The Commerce team owns the full subscription lifecycle across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes acquisition, conversion, billing, identity, and retention — across WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, IBD, and related brands.

Commerce operates as a **platform team** — solutions typically need to work across multiple brands and surfaces.

## Team lead

**Daniel Hockley** — VP of Product, Commerce (Mar 2025–Present)
Reports to: Ryan Daly (SVP, Consumer Product)

## Teams within Commerce

| Team | Focus | Customer journey stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SEO | Organic search visibility and traffic acquisition across WSJ, MarketWatch, Barron's | Traffic & Audience Growth |
| Subscriber Acquisition | Paywalls, shop pages, checkout, registration, offers | Registration & Nurture → Conversion |
| Subscriber Engagement, Revenue & Retention | Onboarding, upsell, save offers, win-back, churn reduction | Activation → Engagement → Retention |
| Subscriber Mobile | Mobile app subscription commerce across iOS and Android | Spans acquisition through retention |
| Identity & Entitlements | Authentication, access control, user identity across all platforms and brands | Infrastructure layer |

## Customer journey framework

```
Traffic & Audience Growth → Registration & Nurture → Conversion → Activation → Engagement & Revenue → Retention & Win-back
        (SEO)                   (Reg, Newsletters)    (Paywall/Checkout)  (Onboarding)    (Upsell, CRM)      (Save offers, Win-back)
```

## Products

The Commerce team owns a portfolio of discrete applications and platforms spanning this journey. See `products.md` for the full inventory with descriptions and dependencies.

Key product areas:
- **Full-funnel infrastructure** — Mosaic (subscription platform), Automated Pricing (ML-driven personalized offers)

## Key platforms and tools

## Strategic context

- Identity/authentication layer is increasingly strategic — first-party data, personalisation, and bundling all depend on it
- WSJ+ bundle strategy is a key growth lever — expanding multi-product subscriptions
- Legal, privacy, and InfoSec reviews are standard dependencies for anything touching identity or billing
- Platform team remit means solutions typically need to work across multiple brands and surfaces
- Checkout friction is a known gap vs. competitors (NYT, Bloomberg) — reducing drop-off is an ongoing investment
- Registered user base is a key growth area — free registrations act as a nurture layer before paid conversion

# Ways of Working — Commerce Product Team

How the Dow Jones Commerce product team operates day to day.

## Team structure

Commerce operates as a **platform team** — serving both Consumer (B2C) and B2B sides of the business. Solutions typically need to work across multiple brands and surfaces.

## Leadership triad model

Every pod has a leadership triad with equal representation from Product, Engineering, and Design. The Commerce senior leadership triad:
- **Product:** Daniel Hockley (VP)
- **Engineering:** Ajith Ittan / Ratheesh Nair (VP)
- **Design:** Min Chung / Jesús Gorriti (VP)

## Quarterly planning

Commerce produces quarterly roadmaps aligned to annual OKRs. The planning process:

1. **Backlog review** — Product, Engineering, and stakeholders review existing backlog items and decide what to carry forward
2. **Force rank** — Stakeholders produce a force-ranked list of new and existing priorities
3. **LOE & capacity calculation** — Tech team produces high-level estimates; capacity calculated against available engineering sprints
4. **Roadmap proposal & alignment** — Tech, Marketing, Business, and Newsroom teams align on what is committed vs. backlogged

Each initiative is then:
- Categorised by objective (Acquisition, Retention, Revenue, Engagement, Identity, SEO, Enterprise)
- Assigned to a pod and PM
- Flagged for design dependency
- T-shirt sized (S/M/L) for Engineering and Design independently
- Assigned a deliverable type (Discovery / Design / Development / Backlog)

## Deliverable types

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery | Product-led research; delivers problem statement, vision, solutions, ROI, and requirements |
| Design | Design & research delivers high-res, signed-off designs |
| Development | Engineering delivers code-complete, releasable product or feature |
| Backlog | Deferred — no work committed this quarter |

## T-shirt sizing

| Size | Duration | Sprints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S | 2 weeks | 1 sprint |
| M | 6 weeks | 3 sprints |
| L | Whole quarter | ~3 months |

## Tracking tool

**Jira Product Discovery (JPD)** — status health tracked via RAG (Red / Amber / Green / On Hold)

## Working with marketing

The Central Marketing Org (CMO) is the primary consumer stakeholder. They are accountable for subscription targets and use Commerce products as one channel in an omni-channel strategy. Commerce and marketing teams are structured around the same customer journey stages: Acquisition, Engagement, Revenue, Retention.

## Key marketing partners

| Name | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Greg Ragon | SVP, Performance Marketing — overall marketing lead |
| Sarah Hilston | VP, Global Acquisition & Paid Media |
| Chris Stanco | VP, Engagement & Retention |

## Product philosophy

- Start with the problem, not the solution — work backwards, define and validate the problem first
- PRDs are thinking tools, not forms — writing forces clarity
- Collaborative by design — PRDs are built with the triad (PM, Design, Engineering), not handed down
- PRDs are living documents — maintained throughout development, not filed away after kickoff
- Shipping is an output, not an outcome — measure what changed in the world (subscriber growth, retention, engagement), not what the team delivered
- Use the double diamond — diverge to discover the problem fully, converge on solutions

## FILE:teams/messaging/team.md
# Messaging Team

The Messaging team owns the core infrastructure for delivering email newsletters, alerts, and push notifications across Dow Jones consumer brands.

## Domain Ownership

### Messaging Team (Internal)

- **PANDA**: Core orchestration hub for content ingestion, template management, and delivery logic.
- **ENS**: Legacy subscription database.
- **MEGA**: Middleware syncing ENS to Campaign Monitor.

### Partner Systems (Internal Tech Partners)

- **Publishing Systems**: Owns NewsPress (internal CMS for newsletter/article content) and Curation (internal tool for manual programming and triggering).
- **Breaking News**: Includes the WSJ Breaking News Tool (used by newsroom/Opinion) and BAT Tool (MarketWatch), both communicating directly to Airship.
- **Brand Teams**: Vertical tech teams (web/mobile) integrating with ENS and Airship for preference management.
- **NAPL (Native Ads Platform)**: Internal tool for AdOps to program and deliver native ads content.

## Six Use Cases

1. **Written Newsletters**: Content is manually written as an article in NewsPress and triggered via Curation; requires high coordination and custom template development.
2. **Automated Newsletters**: Driven by pre-defined content queries (e.g., "Most Read") and delivered on a set schedule without manual assembly.
3. **Automated Alerts ("Follow")**: Real-time alerts for authors or topics; first native PANDA/Sailthru use cases.
4. **Triggered Alerts (Breaking News)**: Manually triggered for urgent news; currently involves a fragmented workflow and manual email assembly.
5. **Transactional**: System-triggered communications (e.g., password resets) currently hard-coded within brand front-ends.
6. **Courses/Journeys**: Automated email series; content and logic hosted natively within Sailthru.
7. **Move to Marketing**: Non-editorial products targeted for hand-off to marketing platforms.

## Known Issues and Opportunities

- **Identity Silos**: No shared backend links mobile push (Airship) and email (ENS/PANDA), preventing a unified preference view.
- **Template Debt**: Technical readiness still needed for MG, FN, and PEN templates, and specialized variants for WSJ Opinion and Pro.
- **New Patterns**: Transactional and Triggered Alerts remain 100% on legacy systems and require new PANDA logic and centralized tooling for breaking news.
- **Onboarding Dependency**: 21 "Configured in Production" products stalled pending editorial training and onboarding.
- **Operational Latency**: WSJ editors' manual "double-build" for breaking news results in a 10-20 minute email latency gap.

# Publishing Systems — Platform Product

> Last updated: 2026-03-29

## Overview

Publishing Systems provides the core editorial and publishing tools that power Dow Jones consumer newsrooms end-to-end: from story planning, to writing and packaging, to publishing across web, apps, and other channels.

Goal: give editors and reporters a fast, reliable, and unified "OneCMS" experience while retiring legacy tools and fragmentation.

**Product Lead:** Clarissa Matthews

## Teams

NewsGrid, NewsPress, Editorial Tools (covers Curation, Chartlos, Image Manager), DMI, Print & Newswires.

## Products

Not called "WSJ+ Bundle" in customer-facing copy — just "WSJ+".

**Triad:** E: Travis Johnson | P: Clarissa Matthews | D: Forest Evashevski | O: Mushirah Kelley

## Ownership split

| Area | Owner |
| --- | --- |

## Core features

### WSJ+ Dashboard
Centralized, cross-brand news and markets hub exclusive to WSJ+ subscribers on the web. Owned by the WSJ product team.

Top-level layout:
- Top News aggregated from all eligible brands
- Today's Markets snapshot
- Your Watchlist for user-selected securities
- Below the fold: recommended stories based on followed companies, industries, and interests

### MyWSJ / MyWSJ+
MyWSJ is the personalized hub inside the WSJ ecosystem (primarily app, with web redesign work in progress). Owned by the WSJ product team.

MyWSJ is a modular, personalized feed ("For You") surfacing:
- Algorithmic recommendations
- Followed companies, topics, and authors
- Saved and shortlisted content

It is also the central place to manage followed entities and personal reading queue.

**MyWSJ+** is the enhanced experience for WSJ+ subscribers within MyWSJ:
- When `user.isMyWsjPlusSubscriber` is true, the feed queries recommendations from all bundle brands (WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch and, where applicable, IBD) instead of WSJ-only
- Cards are brand-badged so users can identify which brand a recommendation comes from
- Gated by the `showMyWSJPlus` feature flag
- Acts as the in-app "home" for WSJ+ cross-brand content discovery
- Supports WSJ+ International via the MyWSJ+ tab as the cross-title experience in apps

### WSJ+ News For You
Onsite recommendation module on WSJ.com, Barrons.com, and MarketWatch.com. Recommends relevant articles from across the bundle to WSJ+ subscribers.

### Your Daily Discover
Multi-title personalized newsletter surfacing the most relevant stories from across the bundle. Exclusive to WSJ+ subscribers.

### Unified preference and alerts experience
One place to manage alerts, newsletters, and watchlists across all titles (WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, IBD).

### Personalized onboarding
On signup: interests, industries, watchlist, alerts, newsletters, and app downloads — sets up the personalized experience from day one.

## WSJ+ Marketplace
Premium marketplace where WSJ+ members can buy add-on products at discounted rates. Examples: Leaderboard, MarketDiem, IBD courses, Barron's premium newsletters.

## Availability and model

- Individual/ecommerce digital subscriptions only — no corporate
- Initially US-only; expanding to select international markets via WSJ+ International
- Former "Investor Bundle" (4-product) and US 3-product bundles have been migrated onto WSJ+ entitlements

## How customers subscribe or upgrade

- Shop page journeys on WSJ.com, Barrons.com, MarketWatch.com: new WSJ+ long-scroll shop page (subset of WSJ traffic) and legacy shop with WSJ+ presented in place of prior bundles
- Customer Center upgrade flow for eligible subscribers
- "Get WSJ+" and "Upgrade to WSJ+" CTAs in nav, onsite modules, and account hub

## Who it's for

- High-value consumer subscribers wanting cross-brand news and investing coverage in a single experience
- Multi-brand loyalists across WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, and IBD
- Upsell candidates from WSJ-only or other bundles into a higher-value tier

## Early performance data (FY25)

- 25% of 4-product and 15% of 3-product bundle subscribers engaging with WSJ+ articles
- Strong cross-brand reading behavior observed
- ~300% growth in dashboard page views since launch

## Notes
- There is no separate WSJ+ app — customers download individual apps for WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, and IBD
- WSJ+ is the product brand; entitlement and access are managed through the Commerce/Identity stack

# Messaging Infrastructure

The Dow Jones messaging infrastructure is transitioning from legacy, brand-specific stacks toward a centralized architecture centered on **PANDA**.

**Primary mission**: Migrate all email products from Campaign Monitor to Sailthru by December 31, 2027, to satisfy contract exit requirements.

As of January 2026: 15% of 138 in-scope products are fully migrated, 15% are configured for production (awaiting onboarding), and 70% require brand-specific template development or new centralized service logic.

## Core Systems

- **PANDA**: Central orchestration engine. Future-state source of truth for user management and subscription data.
- **ENS**: Legacy source of truth for email subscriptions. Bridged to PANDA via a proxy for data parity.
- **MEGA**: Legacy middleware synchronizing data between ENS and Campaign Monitor.

## Vendors

| Vendor | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Sailthru (Zeta) | Target ESP for all newsletter products |
| Campaign Monitor (Marigold) | Legacy ESP; to be decommissioned Dec 31, 2026 |
| Airship | Mobile and web push notifications, managed at brand level |
| Braze | Used by Marketing for lifecycle journeys, independent of PANDA |
| Pushly | Limited MarketWatch desktop alerts |

## FILE:process/product-development.md
# Product Development Process

How work moves from idea to shipped feature at Dow Jones Consumer Products.

## Document types

### 1-Pager
Used to sell a product idea and get stakeholder alignment. Comes before a PRD.

**Purpose:**
- Gain support for the idea — provide context for the problem being solved, for whom
- Define scope — what does the work entail, and what does it not include
- Set success metrics — what does success look like?

**Audience:** Stakeholders, leadership, team

### PRD (Product Requirements Document)
Expands on the 1-pager with deeper research, analysis, and execution detail. Created after the 1-pager has been socialised and discovery has begun.

**Purpose:**
- Defines the problem and solution for everyone who will work on it
- Defines requirements for MVP and beyond
- Sets expectations for stakeholders
- Reduces scope creep and assumptions

**Audience:** Product triads (PM + Design + Engineering), stakeholders, PMO

See `process/templates/1pager-prd-template.md` — contains both the 1-Pager and PRD templates.

## Stages

### 1. Discovery
- Define and validate the problem before proposing solutions
- Key output: 1-Pager, problem statement, opportunity sizing
- Use the double diamond: diverge to discover the problem fully, converge on solutions

### 2. Definition
- Build the PRD in collaboration with the triad (PM, Design, Engineering)
- PRDs are living documents — maintained throughout development, not filed after kickoff
- Key output: PRD with requirements, success metrics, dependencies

### 3. Design
- Design and Engineering work together from the PRD
- Design reviews involve the triad and relevant stakeholders
- Accessibility is a standard consideration

### 4. Build
- Sprint structure: S (1 sprint / 2 weeks), M (3 sprints / 6 weeks), L (whole quarter)
- Tracking in Jira Product Discovery (JPD) with RAG status
- Deliverable types: Discovery / Design / Development / Backlog

### 5. Launch
- Governed by launch tier — not everything requires the same level of process
- Key dependencies: Legal/Privacy for anything touching identity or billing; InfoSec for data flows
- See `process/go-to-market.md`

### 6. Post-launch
- Success measured against pre-defined metrics — outcome-based, not output-based
- A/B test results reviewed and decisions made to ship, iterate, or kill

## Triad model

Every pod has a core triad: PM + Design + Engineering working together from discovery through delivery.

## Key tools

| Tool | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| Jira Product Discovery (JPD) | Roadmap, initiative tracking, RAG status |
| Confluence | Documentation, team wiki |

## Standard dependencies for identity/billing work

Legal, Privacy, and InfoSec reviews are standard for anything touching identity, authentication, billing, or personal data. These are not launch gates — they should be initiated early in discovery.

# 1-Pager vs PRD

### TL;DR: Use a 1-Pager to sell a product idea and a PRD to build on it.

### **What is a 1-Pager?**

The 1-pager helps you put a stake in the ground. It clarifies what you are trying to do, what is your hypothesis, what are your expectations for success, and what the impact will be. This document will help you sell your idea to stakeholders and leadership, and to initiate Discovery with your triad and team.

**Purpose:**

1. Gain support for your idea \- provide context for the problem you’re solving, for whom
2. Define scope \- what does the work entail, and what does it *not* include
3. Success metrics \- what does success look like? What results do you expect?

**Audience:**

* Stakeholders
* Leadership
* Team

### **What is a PRD?**

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a document that helps a product manager develop an idea and communicate it to others involved in the project, so that work can be planned and execution can begin. It should come from the 1-pager and discovery.

**Purpose**

1. Defines the problem and solution for everyone who will work on it
2. Defines requirements \- information that is necessary for MVP and beyond
3. Sets expectations for stakeholders
4. Reduces scope creep
5. Reduces assumptions

**Audience**
A well-written PRD will provide information for various audiences, from triad partners, to start the conversation, to engineering teams, who will build the solution, to stakeholders, who are invested in the learnings or success of the solution. A PRD will become a working document that can be developed and referred back to as a project progresses.

# 1-Pager Template

### The 1-pager helps you put a stake in the ground. It clarifies what you are trying to do, what is your hypothesis, what is expected success, and what the impact will be. This document will help you sell your idea to stakeholders and leadership, and to initiate discovery with your triad and team. At this stage try not to be too prescriptive about what to deliver and leave space for collaborative development.

— \[Delete above this line\]
\[Initiative Title\]

**One-line Summary**
\[Write a TLDR; Capture the product’s objective as concisely as possible. Think of what problem are we solving, why is it important and what impact it might have? Provide clarity and context right from the start to help readers quickly grasp the initiative's purpose.

Example: “A paywall embedded within the video player prompting users to subscribe to continue watching.”\]

#### **Problem**

\[What is the problem, challenge or gap that’s been identified? Who does it affect? Try not to refer to the solution at this stage, just talk about the problem at hand. A problem statement should never just be the need for a specific feature we are hoping to build. Include any data or evidence you have that illustrates the problem.

Example: “We are unable to paywall videos consistently across platforms, missing out on an opportunity to convert subscribers on premium video content.”\]

**Goal(s) / Solution opportunity**
\[What does the solution need to achieve at a high level? If we solve this problem what will we get? What value will this work bring to the company, if it is successful? Conversely, what will DJ *miss out on* by not doing it? How will this give DJ competitive advantage?

Example: “If we paywall video content within the player we will increase paywall impressions on video content and drive subscription revenue we would otherwise miss out on.”\]

#### **Risks and Mitigation**

\[What are known risks, and how do you plan to mitigate them?

Example: “Video views may drop overall, reducing advertising revenue.”\]

**Success Metrics**
\[What does success look like? How will you measure success? How will you validate progress and success?

Example: “Monthly paywall impressions”\]

**Proposed Solution(s)**
\[If you already have an idea or ideas for a solution, describe them here. Be directional but not prescriptive at UI level.

Example: “A paywall embedded in the video player, prompting users to subscribe.” is better than “An overlay on the video player with a button that links users to a shop page.”\]

**Must Haves**
\[List any mandatory requirements here. This doesn’t need to include everything, but should be based on what you know today.

Example: Must work across the website and mobile app.\]

# PRD Template

### The PRD expands on the 1-pager to provide more in-depth research, analysis and execution details. It is mostly created by the Product Manager, who is responsible for clearly defining what and why an initiative is important. How we accomplish the goal should be defined in close collaboration with Design and Engineering.

### Some of the information will come from your 1-pager, and some from discovery. The information you put into the PRD will help define your project so that the team can begin work.

#### **Vision**

\[Make a statement about the impact you expect to make when this work is complete. How does this vision align with the [Dow Jones Mission and Vision](https://intranet.dowjones.com/home/ls/content/5294558629855232/who-we-are#mission)?

Example: “Turn our video content into a high volume subscription driver.”\]

**Goal(s) / Solution opportunity**
\[What does the solution need to achieve at a high level? If we solve this problem, what will we get? What value will this work bring to the company, if it is successful? Conversely, what will DJ *miss out on* by not doing it? How will this give DJ competitive advantage?

#### **Assumptions and Constraints**

\[What are the assumptions you are basing your hypothesis on? What are the technical, business, legal, or other constraints you know of?\]

#### **Audience**

\[Who is the audience or beneficiary for this solution? What do we know about them? Include any audience  you have or define the audience you want to serve. Consider who makes the purchasing decision, as in the customer, versus who will use this, as in the user, and who others might experience the consequences of its use.\]

#### **Success Metrics**

\[How will you measure success? How will you validate progress and success?\]

|  | *Name* | *Definition* | *Current Baseline Performance & Target* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Topline Metric** | Example: Monthly Paywall impressions per pageview | The total number of times a paywall is seen by a user / overall pageviews per month | Baseline: 0.1 Target: 0.3 |
| **Secondary Metric** |  |  |  |
| **Counter Metric** | Example: Monthly video ad impressions | The total number of video ads viewed monthly | Baseline: 1.2M Target: Maintain the baseline. |

#### **Risks and Mitigation**

\[What are known risks, and how do you plan to mitigate them?

Example: “Video views may drop overall, reducing advertising revenue.”\]

#### **Scope & Requirements**

\[What user stories must be fulfilled by the solution? Design and engineering teams will use these to make sure the product achieves everything it needs to to fulfill the user and business needs. Try to focus on user needs without prescribing solutions. Leave enough space for design and engineering teams to explore multiple paths and solutions.\]

\[What is a must have or nice to have for MVP? What is not part of MVP, and can be added after launch? What is the definition of done, and what maintenance and monitoring should follow?\]

| Requirement Title | Description | User Story (optional) | Scope | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Example: Sale pricing | The ability to change pricing that is displayed during sale periods or update pricing to match the current offer. | As a user, I want to see sale pricing within the video player so that I can quickly weigh up my purchasing decision and proceed to purchase. | MVP / Must have / Nice to have | Marketing operations should be able to run sales without the need for engineering involvement.  |
| Example 2: Flexible branding across DJs consumer brands. | … | … | … | … |

#### **Dependencies**

\[Does your solution have any dependencies on other teams or tooling? Are there Design, UX, or Accessibility considerations? Are there legal requirements or reviews that need to be incorporated into your plan? Are there any other teams or projects that are dependent on your solution, which might impact timing of your deliverable?\]

#### **Timing**

\[Is there a hard date by which this needs to be launched, or other timing considerations to be mindful of?\]

#### **RACI (Optional. For large initiatives)**

| Team | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |

## FILE:style/writing.md
# Writing Style — Dow Jones Commerce Product Team

Voice, tone, and conventions for internal product documentation.

## Core principles

- **Concise, direct, actionable** — shorter and clearer beats comprehensive and unread
- **Subheadings are essential** — use them in all substantive writing, even short documents. The best subheadings summarize the point, not just label the topic. A reader should understand the key idea from the heading alone.
- **Write for skim readers** — dense blocks of text lose people. Short paragraphs, clear headings, simple language.
- **Bullet points have limits** — keep lists to under 6 items. Each bullet should be one short sentence. If a bullet is running long, it's probably a paragraph. If a list is running long, break it into themed sections.

## Language

- Always use **American English** spelling: recognize, analyze, color, prioritize, optimize
- No emojis in professional documents
- Avoid internal jargon without explanation — use the glossary (`company/glossary.md`)

## PRD writing principles

- **Start with the problem, not the solution** — stakeholders often arrive with fully formed solutions; work backwards
- **PRDs are thinking tools, not forms** — writing forces clarity; if you struggle to define the problem, the initiative may not be ready
- **Be outcome-based** — success metrics should connect to subscription KPIs (paywall impressions, CVR, subscriber acquisition, churn, ARPU), not just outputs
- **Simple scales** — front-load with the most important information

## Naming conventions

| Preferred | Avoid | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Wall Street Journal | WSJ (in external-facing copy) | WSJ is fine internally |
| MarketWatch | Market Watch (one word) | |
| Commerce team | Subscriptions team | Team was renamed to Commerce in Mar 2025 |
| OneID | One ID | Single word |

## Document audiences

| Document type | Primary audience |
| --- | --- |
| 1-Pager | Stakeholders, leadership |
| PRD | Product triad (PM + Design + Engineering), stakeholders, PMO |
| Roadmap | Leadership, marketing stakeholders, cross-functional partners |
| Quarterly planning summary | Tech, Marketing, Business, Newsroom teams |
